# Hey guys, I'm Arthur 👋

I'm a **Junior Web Developer** at the beginning of my professional journey, currently focused on **Front-end development**, while training to become a **Full-stack Web Developer** through the TripleTen Web Development Bootcamp.

I have hands-on experience building **responsive and well-structured web applications** using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**, including projects that consume external APIs and follow best practices for code organization and usability.

## 👨‍💻 Technical Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript (Vanilla JS), HTML5, CSS3  
- **Front-end:** React, Responsive Design, Flexbox, Grid  
- **Tools & Workflow:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, NPM  
- **Concepts:** API consumption, component-based architecture, clean and readable code

## 🏗️ Background & Transferable Skills

I hold a degree in **Architecture (2018)** and previously worked on projects that combined **technology, construction, and management**.  
In this role, I led multidisciplinary teams, managed timelines, dealt directly with clients, and solved complex, real-world problems — skills that translate naturally into software development.

Additionally, I have experience with **digital marketing, automation, and data analysis**, which strengthened my understanding of **product thinking, usability, and user-centered solutions**. This background helps me approach front-end development not only from a technical perspective, but also from a **business and user experience** point of view.

- Learn from more experienced developers

I'm open to **on-site, hybrid, or remote** opportunities and highly motivated to grow within a team.
